# Utilizing Satellite Imagery To Estimate Oil Reserve Volumes In Storage Tanks

Oil storage tanks play an important role in the global economy. Crude oil is stored in tanks at many points between extraction and sale. Storage tanks are also used by nations to stockpile oil reserves. The volume of oil in storage is an important economic indicator. It indicates which oil producing nations are increasing or decreasing production and gives a window into the global demand for energy. At the same time, oil storage information is not transparent. Nations may hide information about oil production, consumption and storage for economic or military reasons. For this reason, companies like Planet and Orbital Insight have made a business of collecting satellite imagery of oil storage tanks and estimating reserve volumes.

Tank volume estimation is possible because oil is typically stored in floating head tanks. This particular tank type has a head that sits directly on top of the crude oil to prevent buildup of fumes. As a result, the height of the tank head rises and falls with the volume of oil in the tank. The relative sizes of the exterior shadow cast by the tank itself and the interior shadow cast by the height of the tank head can be used to estimate the tank volume.
